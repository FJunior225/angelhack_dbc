Shgr’nee did the introduction part - His name is Rafael from Yelp, in charge of engineering staffing in SF - https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelrice <https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelrice>. This is what Shgr’nee said: Hi Rafael, My name is Shar'nee Francis and I am the Career Coach and Diversity Advocate at Dev Bootcamp. I really admire your background and the work you are doing in Staffing and Recruiting. Looks like we both started our journey at RHI. I wanted to connect you with FJ Collins, a Software Engineer I worked with in NYC. He looking to relocate to SF and is interested in building a network with local change makers in the SF tech community. Thank you for taking time to engage, I'll let the two of you take it from here! Regards, Shar'nee and I was looking to respond with this… Thanks Shar’nee! Hello Rafael, how are you? As Shar’nee explained, I am looking to relocate to SF and looking to build a network and to express interest in any roles Yelp-Eat24 is recruiting for that focus on Ruby and/or JavaScript. I have experience developing web applications in a team-oriented environment using a full technology stack. I have excellent time management and planning skills, and I enjoy the rigors of a fast-paced environment. At your convenience, I was hoping we can set up a phone intro early next week, perhaps Tuesday afternoon? Thanks, and I look forward to speaking with you soon! Respectfully, FJ Let me know what you think!!
